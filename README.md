## About CodeToExpress

We intend to change the generic definition of teaching, a teacher must become the best friend of student, to make learning much more interesting. Letâ€™s come together, discuss ideas, teach each other and help each other grow. Learning together makes growth faster and enjoyable.

Next time someone asks you why you code? Tell him/her, "I CODE TO EXPRESS"

## Our Aim

Aim of the community is to connect experts from all domains to medium and beginner developers so that when choosing the domain, they donâ€™t follow the herd, but they get to know about the domains of their choice and choose what they love.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.
